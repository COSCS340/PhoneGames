## Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of our demo (March 21st) we had the following features implemented: a login system, two working games, and a user friendly website. All of which were deployed to our website using Google Cloud’s app engine and virtual machine servers. The login system allows every user that visits our site to create an account using any unique username and password they desire. In order to keep track of everyone as they play, we require that every user has an account before exploring what games we have to offer. The reason we do this is to simplify bookkeeping on our end and to ensure that our users will have a better overall experience. The two games we demoed were hangman and tic-tac-toe, both used to showcase our website’s interactivity and demonstrate the groundwork we’ve performed thus far.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for changes to our project, we’ve had to switch CSS stylesheets multiple times because our mobile UI/UX is lacking severely compared to other modern websites and we’re still not satisfied with our website’s design. Also, many of the early packages we tried using for the accounts system lacked the functionality that we needed so we had to take an existing one and expand it to meet our requirements. And we were originally going to host our app on DigitalOcean, but due to some unfortunate circumstances, our hosting credit disappeared and we had to port the entire project to Google Cloud instead.

## Customer Value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of the project, our customer value section hasn’t been effected. Despite the changes we made to our requirements and overall design that was noted in the introduction, they have had no effect on whom we perceive to be our target audience or what our final solution will deliver to our intended audience.

## Team
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we first started the project we divided the work into 2 main groups: game development and website development. Jerry and Preston both worked on the website side of the project while Michael and Howard worked on game development. As time went on, Jerry’s role evolved to handle the login system, the website experience, and integrating the basic games we had into the site. Preston also moved from front-end development to deploying the website and ensure that all of the packages and databases we used would work with Google Cloud.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward, everyone’s role will slowly evolve as we get closer to the final deadline and finish creating and implementing our main games. Jerry will make sure that newly created games are integrated seamlessly with the site and perform QA testing to ensure our users’ experience is bug-free. Preston will continue to work on a site-wide chat system and then move to performing penetration tests to make sure our users’ data is secure. Michael will be in charge of creating and playtesting our main games, refining the rules and visuals to keep users coming back. And lastly, Howard will shift his focus creating a more intuitive and appealing website by redesigning most of the its UI, layout, and overall experience.

## Project Management
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the time of submitting our status report, our project is on schedule and will be ready to present by the end of next month. All of the large hurdles we had to get over such as the login system and lobbies have been fully implemented and all that’s left to do is to finish implementing our primary games and redesign the UI.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the start of the semester, we have had to push many features back by a few weeks because there was an initial learning curve that we didn’t predict. Because of that, the initial schedule we outlined in our initial proposal and through github’s issue tracker had to be pushed back by two weeks. Despite that setback, we’ve managed to catch up to our original schedule through hard work and we are on track to complete our project in the next three weeks like originally planned.
