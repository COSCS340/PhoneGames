## Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of our demo (March 21st) we had the following features implemented: a login system, two working games, and a user friendly website. All of which were deployed to our website using Google Cloud’s app engine and virtual machine servers. The login system allows every user that visits our site to create an account using any unique username and password they desire. In order to keep track of everyone as they play, we require that every user has an account before exploring what games we have to offer. The reason we do this is to simplify bookkeeping on our end and to ensure that our users will have a better overall experience. The two games we demoed were hangman and tic-tac-toe, both used to showcase our website’s interactivity and demonstrate the groundwork we’ve performed thus far.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for changes to our project, we’ve had to switch CSS stylesheets multiple times because our mobile UI/UX is lacking severely compared to other modern websites and we’re still not satisfied with our website’s design. As well as many of the early packages we tried using for the accounts system lacked the functionality that we needed so we had to take an existing one and expand it to meet our requirements. And we were originally going to host our app on DigitalOcean, but due to some unfortunate circumstances, our hosting credit disappeared and we had to port the entire project to Google Cloud instead.

## Customer Value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of the project, our customer value section hasn’t been effected. Despite the changes we made to our requirements and overall design that was noted in the introduction, they have had no effect on whom we perceive to be our target audience or what our final solution will deliver.
